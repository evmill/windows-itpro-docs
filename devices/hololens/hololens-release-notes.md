### Support for Windows Autopilot 

Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2 lets the device sales channel pre-enroll HoloLens into your Intune tenant.  When devices arrive, they’re ready to self-deploy as shared devices under your tenant. To take advantage of self-deployment, devices will need to connect to a network during the first screen in setup using either a USB-C to ethernet dongle or USB-C to LTE dongle. 

When a user starts the Autopilot self-deploying process, the process completes the following steps: 

1. Join the device to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). 
1. Use Azure AD to enroll the device in Microsoft Intune (or another MDM service). 
1. Download the device-targeted policies, certificates, and networking profiles. 
1. Provision the device. 
1. Present the sign-in screen to the user. 

Learn more from the [Windows Autopilot for HoloLens 2 evaluation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens2-autopilot).

**Contact your Account Manager to join the AutoPilot preview now. Autopilot-ready devices will begin shipping soon.**

### FIDO2 Security Key support 

Many of you share a HoloLens device with lots of people in a work or school environment. Whether devices are shared between students in a classroom or they're checked out from a device locker, it's important to be able to change users quickly and easily without typing long usernames and passwords. 

FIDO lets anyone in your organization (AAD tenant) seamlessly sign into HoloLens without entering a username or password. 

FIDO2 security keys are an unphishable standards-based passwordless authentication method that can come in any form factor. Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is an open standard for passwordless authentication. FIDO allows users and organizations to leverage the standard to sign-in to their resources without a username or password using an external security key or a platform key built into a device. 

Read the [passwordless security docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key) to get started. 

### Improved MDM enrollment via provisioning package 

Provisioning packages let you set HoloLens configuration through a config file rather than going through the HoloLens out of box experience. Previously, provisioning packages had to be copied onto HoloLens' internal memory, now they can be on a USB drive so they're easier to re-use on multiple HoloLens and so more people can provision HoloLens in parallel.  In addition, provisioning packages support a new field to enroll in device management so there is no manual set up post-provisioning. 

1. To try it out, download the latest version of the Windows Configuration Designer from the Windows store onto your PC. 
1. Select **Provision HoloLens Devices** > Select **Provision HoloLens 2 devices** 
1. Build your configuration profile and, when you're done, copy all files created to a USB-C storage device. 
1. Plug it into any freshly flashed HoloLens and press **Volume down + Power** to apply your provisioning package. 

### Line of Business application install status 

MDM app deployment and management for Line of Business (LOB) apps is critical for our customers. Admins and users need to be able to view app install status, for auditing and diagnosis purposes. In this release we are adding more details in **Settings > Accounts > Access work or school > Click on your account > Info.**

### Additional CSPs and Policies 

A [configuration service provider (CSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference?redirectedfrom=MSDN) is an interface to read, set, modify, or delete configuration settings on a device. In this release, we are adding support for more policies, increasing the control administrators have over deployed HoloLens devices. For the list of CSPs supported by HoloLens, visit this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/networkqospolicy-csp). New in this release:

**Policy CSP** 

The Policy configuration service provider enables the enterprise to configure policies on Windows devices. In this release, we are adding new policies for HoloLens, listed below. You can learn more about supported policies [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policies-supported-by-hololens2).  

- LetAppsAccessCamera_ForceAllowTheseApps  
- LetAppsAccessCamera_ForceDenyTheseApps  
- LetAppsAccessCamera_UserInControlOfTheseApps 
- LetAppsAccessGazeInput 
- LetAppsAccessGazeInput_ForceAllowTheseApps 
- LetAppsAccessGazeInput_ForceDenyTheseApps 
- LetAppsAccessGazeInput_UserInControlOfTheseApps 
- LetAppsAccessMicrophone_ForceAllowTheseApps 
- LetAppsAccessMicrophone_ForceDenyTheseApps 
- LetAppsAccessMicrophone_UserInControlOfTheseApps 
- AllowWiFi 

**NetworkQoSPolicy CSP** 
The NetworkQoSPolicy configuration service provider creates network Quality of Service (QoS) policies. A QoS policy performs a set of actions on network traffic based on a set of matching conditions. You can learn more about this policy [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/networkqospolicy-csp). 

### Expanded USB Ethernet support for 5G/LTE tethered devices

Support has been added to enable certain mobile broadband devices, such as 5G/LTE phones and WiFi hotpots when tethered to the HoloLens 2 via USB. These devices will be displayed in network settings as another ethernet connection. Mobile broadband devices that require an external driver are not supported. This enables high bandwidth connections in scenarios where WiFi is not available, and WiFi tethering isn’t performant enough. You can learn more about supported USB devices [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-connect-devices).  

### Hand Tracking Improvements

Hand tracking has received several improvements in this release. 

- **Pointing pose stability:** The system will now resist bending the index finger when it becomes occluded by the palm.  This improves accuracy when pushing buttons, typing, scrolling content, and more! 
- **Reduced accidental AirTaps:** We’ve improved detection of the AirTap gesture.  Now there are fewer accidental activations in several common cases, such as dropping your hands to your side. 
- **User switch reliability:** The system is now faster and more reliable at updating the hand size when sharing a device back and forth. 
- **Reduced hand stealing:** We’ve improved handling of cases where there are more than 2 hands in view of the sensors.  If multiple people are working close together, there is now a much lower chance that the tracked hand will jump from the user to the hand of someone else in the scene. 
- **System reliability:** Fixed an issue that would cause hand tracking to stop working for a period if the device is under high load. 

### Dark mode

Many Windows apps now support both dark and light modes, and HoloLens 2 customers can choose the default mode for apps that support both. Once updated, the default app mode will be "dark," but can be changed easily. Navigate to Settings > System > Colors to find "Choose your default app mode." Here are some of the in-box apps that support Dark mode: 

- Settings 
- Microsoft Store 
- Mail 
- Calendar 
- File Explorer 
- Feedback Hub 
- OneDrive 
- Photos 
- 3D Viewer 
- Movies & TV

### System voice commands

You can now quickly access and use commands with your voice while using any app on the device. If you're running your system with a different language, please try the appropriate commands in that language. For more details on the commands and how to use them, see our documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-cortana).  

### Cortana updates 

The updated app integrates with Microsoft 365, currently in English (United States) only, to help you get more done across your devices. On HoloLens 2, Cortana will no longer support certain device-specific commands like adjusting the volume or restarting the device, which are now supported with the new system voice commands mentioned above. Learn more about the new Cortana app and its direction on our blog [here](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/02/28/cortana-in-the-upcoming-windows-10-release-focused-on-your-productivity-with-enhanced-security-and-privacy/). 

> [!NOTE]
> There's currently an issue we're investigating that requires you to launch the app after booting the device in order to use the "Hey Cortana" keyword activation, and if you updated from a 18362 build, you may see an app tile for the previous version of the Cortana app in Start that no longer works. 

### Quality improvements and fixes 

Improvements and Fixes also in the update:  
- The update introduces an active display calibration system. This improves the stability and alignment of holograms, which helps them stay in place when moving your head side-to-side. 
- Fixed a bug where Wi-Fi streaming to HoloLens gets disrupted periodically. If an application indicates that it needs low latency streaming this fix is can be accomplished by calling [this function](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/socketapi/nf-socketapi-setsocketmediastreamingmode). 
- Fixed an issue where the device could hang during streaming in research mode. 
- Fixed bug where in some cases the right user would not be displayed on sign-in screen when resuming session. 
- Fixed an issue where users could not export MDM logs through settings. 
- Fixed an issue where the accuracy of eye tracking immediately following out-of-box-setup could be lower than specification. 
- Fixed an issue where eye tracking subsystem would fail to initialize and/or perform calibration under certain conditions. 
- Fixed an issue where eye calibration would be prompted for an already calibrated user. 
- Fixed an issue where a driver would crash during eye calibration. 
- Fixed an issue where repeated power button presses can cause a 60 second system time-out and shell crash. 
- Improved stability for depth buffers. 
- Added ‘Share’ button in Feedback Hub so users can more easily share feedback. 
- Fixed a bug where RoboRaid did not install correctly.
